# Netflix

Netflix is a subscription-based streaming platform that allows users to view movies and TV-shows.
Netflix generates revenue in 2 ways:
- subscription plans
  - There are 3 payment plans: Basic, Standard, Premium.
- DVD rentals

We will only be looking at subscribers

Assumptions:
- There is no data on the type of plans that were used, so we will assume that all subscribers applied for the standard plan.
  - From 2018 to 2019, the cost of the standard plan of Netflix jumped from $10.99 to $12.99.
    - We will assume that the conversion rate from dollars to other currencies is 1:1 and that the revenue is adjusted to be in dollars.

How well did Netflix perform in terms of Revenue and Subscribers from 2018 to 2019?
- global scale: constant increase from 2018 to 2019 in terms of total revenue and the total number of subscribers


Breaking down Revenue and Subscribers into regions: 

- Where does most of our revenue come from?
1. US & Canada
2. EMEA
3. Latin America
4. Asia-Pacific

- Where dp most of our subscribers come from?
1. US & Canada
2. EMEA
3. Latin America
4. Asia-Pacific


  - US & Canada:
    - leads all regions in the total amount of revenue generated and total number of subscribers
    - constant increase in total revenue
    - increase in total subscribers, except from Q1 2019 to Q2 2019 where there is a drop
      - despite drop in total subscribers, the amount of revenue generated increased
  - EMEA: 
     - constant increase in total revenue and total subscribers
  - Latin America:
     - drop in revenue from Q2 2018 to Q3 2018
     - constant increase in number of subscribers
  - Asia-Pacific:
     - constant increase in total revenue and total subscribers
     - generates more revenue per subscriber than Latin America despite Latin America having more subscribers than Asia-Pacific in 2018 and in 2019

There is another factor that is driving revenue other than subscription plans because the amount of revenue generated per subscriber is greater than the subscription cost. If subscription plans were the only factor driving revenue, then it can be said that the order in which region generates the most revenue is as follows:
  1. US & Canada
  2. EMEA
  3. Latin America
  4. Asia-Pacific
  
However, Asia-Pacific generates more revenue per subscriber than Latin America. The rate at which revenue is generated is not proportionate to the rate of subscribers. In the US & Canada, we see from Q1 2019 to Q3 2019, there is a large spike in revenue despite losing subscribers during the initial stages of that period. Contrastingly in Latin America, there is a drop in revenue from Q2 2018 to Q3 2018, but there was an increase in subscribers. 

Therefore, as important as it is to retain and accumulate more subscribers, it is also important to analyze
