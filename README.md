# Netflix

Netflix is a subscription-based streaming platform that allows users to view movies and TV-shows.
Netflix generates revenue in 2 ways:
- subscription plans
    - There are 3 payment plans: Basic, Standard, Premium.
    
- DVD rentals

We will only be looking at subscriptions.


Assumptions:
- There is no data on the type of plans that were used, so we will assume that all subscribers applied for the standard plan.
  - From 2018 to 2019, the cost of the standard plan of Netflix jumped from $10.99 to $12.99.
- We will assume that the conversion rate from dollars to other currencies is 1:1 and that the revenue is already adjusted to be in dollars.

2. EMEA
3. Latin America
4. Asia-Pacific

- Where do most of our subscribers come from?
1. US & Canada

Quarterly Trend:
  - US & Canada:
    - constant increase in total revenue
    - increase in total subscribers, except from Q1 2019 to Q2 2019 where there is a drop
      - despite drop in total subscribers, the amount of revenue generated increased
  - EMEA: 
     - constant increase in total revenue and total subscribers
  - Latin America:
     - drop in revenue from Q2 2018 to Q3 2018
     - constant increase in number of subscribers

     - constant increase in total revenue and total subscribers

Revenue per Subscriber in 2018 and 2019
- US & Canada lead each year, followed by EMEA
- Asia-Pacific generates more revenue per subscriber than Latin Americadespite having less subscribers



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of subscribers is important in driving revenue. But based on the data, it is not the main factor in generating revenue. If it was, then it can be said that the order in which region generates the most revenue is as follows:
  1. US & Canada
  2. EMEA
  3. Latin America
  4. Asia-Pacific
  
because Latin America has more subscribers than Asia-Pacific.

However, Asia-Pacific generates more revenue per subscriber than Latin America. The rate at which revenue is generated is not proportionate to the rate of subscribers. In the US & Canada, we see from Q1 2019 to Q3 2019, there is a large spike in revenue despite losing subscribers during the initial stages of that period. Contrastingly in Latin America, there is a drop in revenue from Q2 2018 to Q3 2018, but there was an increase in subscribers. 

Therefore, as important as it is to retain and accumulate more subscribers, it is also important to analyze DVD rentals. 
DVD rentals can be assessed in two ways:
1. the quamtity put available for the customers
2. the quality of the DVD rentals
